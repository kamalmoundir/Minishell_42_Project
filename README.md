## üî© Technical Implementation Details

### Lexical Analysis (Lexer)

The lexer is implemented in `src/lexer/` and is responsible for breaking input strings into meaningful tokens. Key technical aspects include:

- **Token Types**: We define different token types (TOKEN_WORD, TOKEN_PIPE, TOKEN_REDIR_IN, TOKEN_REDIR_OUT, TOKEN_APPEND, TOKEN_HEREDOC, TOKEN_EOF) in `lexer.h`.
- **Tokenization Process**: The main tokenization logic in `lexer_init.c` and `tokenizer.c`:
  - Character-by-character analysis with state tracking
  - Special handling for operators, quotes, and word characters
  - Quote state tracking to handle nested quotes correctly
- **Quote Handling**: Implemented in `lexer_word.c` and `lexer_word_utils.c`:
  - Differentiates between single quotes (literal) and double quotes (with variable expansion)
  - Tracks unmatched quotes and reports syntax errors
- **Environment Variable Expansion**: Implemented in `lexer_expand.c`:
  - Detects `$VAR` patterns and expands them with values from environment
  - Special handling for `$?` to return the last command's exit status
  - Conditional expansion inside double quotes but not single quotes

### Parsing & AST Construction

The parser is implemented in `src/parser/` and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the token stream:

- **AST Node Types**: Defined in `includes/parsing.h`:
  - CMD: Simple command node (with arguments)
  - PIPE: Pipeline connector node
  - REDIR_IN/REDIR_OUT/APPEND: Redirection nodes
  - FILENAME: File reference node
- **Recursive Descent Parsing**: Implemented in `parser.c`:
  - Builds a tree structure with proper operator precedence
  - Handles nested commands, pipes, and redirections
  - Validates syntax and detects errors during parsing
- **AST Traversal**: Walking the tree to execute commands in the correct order
- **Command Argument Handling**: Collecting arguments for command execution

### Command Execution

The execution engine is implemented in `src/execution/`:

- **Process Creation**: Creates child processes for command execution
- **Execution Strategy**: Uses fork/exec model to execute external commands
- **Path Resolution**: Uses environment PATH to find executable binaries
- **Exit Status Tracking**: Captures and stores command exit status for `$?` expansion
- **Command Validation**: Checks executable permissions before attempting execution

### Built-in Commands

Built-in commands are implemented in `src/builtins/`:

- **echo**: Supports `-n` flag to suppress newline
- **cd**: Directory navigation with path resolution:
  - Supports relative and absolute paths
  - Updates PWD and OLDPWD environment variables
  - Handles HOME directory when no argument is provided
- **pwd**: Returns current working directory using getcwd
- **export**: Environment variable management:
  - Variable name validation according to POSIX standards
  - Sorted environment variable display
  - Proper handling of quotes in variable values
- **unset**: Removes variables from environment with protection for system variables
- **env**: Lists all environment variables
- **exit**: Shell termination with optional status code:
  - Validates numeric arguments
  - Handles error cases for non-numeric input

### Signal Handling

Signal handling is implemented in `src/signals/signals.c`:

- **SIGINT (Ctrl+C)**: Interrupts current command execution
- **SIGQUIT (Ctrl+\\)**: Ignored in interactive mode, terminates with core dump in child processes
- **Custom Signal Behavior**: Different signal behaviors in parent shell vs child processes
- **Readline Integration**: Proper interaction with readline library for signal handling

### Redirection Implementation

File redirection is handled in `src/execution/redirection_handling.c`:

- **Input Redirection (`<`)**: Redirects file content to command stdin
- **Output Redirection (`>`)**: Redirects command stdout to file (truncate)
- **Append Redirection (`>>`)**: Redirects command stdout to file (append)
- **File Descriptor Management**: Proper handling of file descriptors using dup2
- **Permission Checking**: Validates file permissions before attempting redirection

### Pipe Implementation

Pipe handling is implemented in `src/execution/setup_pipes.c`:

- **Pipe Creation**: Uses pipe() system call to create communication channels
- **Process Management**: Creates multiple processes connected by pipes
- **File Descriptor Redirection**: Connects stdout of one process to stdin of another
- **Pipeline Execution Flow**: Ensures proper execution order in pipelines
- **Exit Status Propagation**: Captures exit status from the last command in the pipeline

### Environment Variable Management

Environment management is implemented across multiple files:

- **Environment Initialization**: Creates a copy of the system environment
- **Variable Lookup**: Fast variable retrieval by name
- **Variable Setting**: Validation and storage of new variables
- **Variable Expansion**: Replaces $VAR with its value during command processing
- **Special Variables**: Handling of special variables like $? (exit status)

### Memory Management

Custom memory management to prevent leaks:

- **Safe Allocation**: Wrapper functions for malloc in `utils_mem.c`
- **Systematic Deallocation**: Structured cleanup of data structures
- **Resource Tracking**: Tracking allocated resources for proper cleanup
- **Leak Prevention**: Careful free() calls throughout the codebase

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling approach:

- **Syntax Errors**: Detected during parsing (unclosed quotes, invalid redirections)
- **Execution Errors**: Command not found, permission denied, etc.
- **System Call Errors**: Checking return values of all system calls
- **Error Reporting**: User-friendly error messages with appropriate context
- **Exit Status Codes**: Standards-compliant exit codes for different error types
